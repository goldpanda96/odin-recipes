            <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Steps
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken in a large mixing bowl. Add the salt, garlic powder and onion powder to the chicken. Toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the buttermilke and hot sauce to the bowl and stir to combine. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, up to overnight.</li>
            <li>In another mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, paprika, cayene pepper, and black pepper to make the dredge.</li>
            <li>Fill the fryer with peanut oil and preheat to 350°F. Cast iron can be used instead but monitor the heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and coat in the flour mixture one at a time. Shake off any excess flour mixture and set the chicken aside to let the coating set.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the chickenm to the fryer. Don't overfill the fryer, 3-4 pieces at a time will do. Fry until golden brown, about 10-12 minutes, turning every few minutes. The chicken is done at an internal temperature of 165°F.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the chicken from the fryer and place it on a paper towel lined sheet tray and sprinkle some flaked salt on top. Let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
